        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>As a passionate front-end web developer with a background in 3D animation, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to my work. My journey began with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Animation from California State University, East Bay, where I honed my skills in visual storytelling and design. Seeking to expand my technical capabilities, I earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the University of California, Berkeley Coding Boot Camp. This diverse skill set allows me to approach web development with a distinctive perspective, ensuring that the user experience is both engaging and intuitive.</p>
        <p>My technical proficiency includes JavaScript ES6+, CSS3, HTML5, SQL, NoSQL, GitHub, MongoDB, MySQL, Express, React, Node, Handlebars, jQuery, and Bootstrap. I have successfully contributed to various projects, such as PlayPoint, a gaming community platform where I served as a backend developer, and SoccerSphere HQ, a soccer information app where I was the front-end designer. Additionally, I authored WeatherApp, a weather forecasting application. My strengths lie in creativity, teamwork, and the ability to take projects from ideation to execution, making me a valuable asset in any development team.</p>
